=====================

## Info

This repo holds work on data quality for altmetrics data, including for:

* Monthly reports inspection, see `monthly`

Montly reports inspection deals with (an outline for now...)

* loading data
* cleaning data
* various summaries by doi, metric, etc.
* Visualize temporal change within __the same__ doi
* Visualize relationship among various metrics for __different__ dois

Alerts deals with (an outline for now...):

* Collection of alerts data using the `alm` R package[^1]
* Extraction of any data within alert messages
* Collection of further altmetrics data to help understand alerts data
* Visualizations to look for patterns
* Statistical models to find patterns

[^1]: Will show Python way of doing this as well when the client is ready.
